Working with live photos and data, each zine, including the past six peoples' photos, names, and responses to the prompts, reveals the faces of and some words from the people within the UCLA Arts community. <br><br>Approximately 70 unique zines were produced for the two hour event.<br>Photo direction by Hannah Burnett.</p>
