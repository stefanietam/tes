A slew of ephemera, wonder, and airiness, this is as serious or as useless as you'd like it to be. Though, if you look hard enough, you may find more overlap than expected. join me in the fun, and maybe we can be friends, maybe you'll fall in love, maybe you'll be hungry, or maybe you will feel absolutely nothing. but i insist, something will change.</p>
